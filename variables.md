## What is variable 
A variable is a quantity that may change within the context of a mathematical problem or experiment. Typically, we use a single letter to represent a variable. The letters x , y , and z are common generic symbols used for variables.

Ex: sum = x + y;
If x = 2 & y = 5 then sum = 7
If x = 4 & y = 6 then sum = 10

In computers also variable is a memory location the value can be changed from time to time.
int x;
   x = 0;
   x = x+2;
If your see above statements the value in x is changing from statement to statement.

## Variable declaration and initialization 
int x; declaration 
   x =0; initialization

String s;
 s= “Pioneer Coders”;
