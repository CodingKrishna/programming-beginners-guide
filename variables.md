# Variables

A Variable is a symbol for a number we don't know yet. It is usually a letter like x or y.

## What is variable 
A variable is a quantity that may change within the context of a mathematical problem or experiment. Typically, we use a single letter to represent a variable. The letters x , y , and z are common generic symbols used for variables.

Ex: sum = x + y;

If x = 2 & y = 5 then sum = 7

If x = 4 & y = 6 then sum = 10

In computers also variable is a memory location the value can be changed from time to time.
int x;

   x = 0;
   
   x = x+2;
   
If your see above statements the value in x is changing from statement to statement.

## Variable declaration and initialization 
int x; declaration

   x =0; initialization

String s;

 s= “Pioneer Coders”;

## What is Data Type?
* We need to understand two words first one Data and second one Type.
#### What is data ? & what is information?
Data is raw facts & figures

Ex: I got 25 marks in exam

25 is data, marks is meta data.

## What is information?
* When data is processed, organized, structured or presented in a given context so as to make it useful, it is called information.

* The average score of a class or of the entire school is information that can be derived from the given data.

## What is type?
* It deals with type of data
* In real world data will be in the form of  Numbers, decimals, characters and Strings.

While we capturing data we need to identify the type of data  also.

## Why we need Data Type in S/W
* To process any real world problems we need to capture data.
* Ex: Find out sum of 2 numbers?

 as we all know in mathematical way 

   sum = x + y where x =2 & y=5; x,y belongs integers.

What is mean by above statement?

The data is captured in the form of variables to generalize (it should work for any kind of data means x=4,y=6) the process.

Software are deals with real world problems to analysis real problems we need data.. So capture the data we required data type.

The accuracy of output of your problem is depends on accurate inputs, so the inputs should captures properly.

To capture data we need data types.

## What kind of variants are there in  data types?

Real data can be possible of bellow types

Numbers 
Decimals 
Characters 
Strings 

Ex : student name is “Pioneer”.

‘name’ is group of characters.

He got 25 marks. 

25 is integer. 


## Data type syntax 
Data type variable name = values;

 Ex: int x =2, y= 5; x and y are variable to     store data of type integers.

char choice=‘y’;

float price = 10.50;

## What is this range and how it help us and why it is required?
While we are evaluating any math equations we consider range also 

Ex: sum = x+y x 0<x<10 & 40<y<50

Above statement says that x should be b/w 0 to 10 and y b/w 40 to 50.

Similarly in computers also we need range to process data.

The range is handled with memory size in computer

Ever data in computers stored in the form of bit’s.

All java data type has memory capacity, based on that it has it Owen range.

## Range calculations.
one bit, can store 1 or 0

one byte can store 8 bits 

So byte data type can store 8 bit of information that means if you put all ones in place of 8 bits we will get max number 128.

Similarly for other data types also

Char means one byte(8 bits ) in computer all characters are represented in the form of numbers using ASCII table.  That means if store 

character actually it stores number.

In ASCII table char are started form 64 to 128.
