## What is class?
Class is used to represent a real time entity in a business usecase to feed into computor in java programing. 

Class is template of an real-time entity. Every entity in this real world has set of properties and it exhibits some behaviors.

We will bind the properties and behaviors into a class.

Class Human {  
	Sting name;  
	String gender;  
	void sleep() { 
  };  
	void walk() {  
  };  
}

### Why we need class?
Actually class keyword is derived from word classification in java, every real entity in this world need to be classified to differentiate.   
Like humans classifies the things, systems also need classification. Java class classifies the real entity's to the system to understand the about entity.  
Ex: Car, Human, Animals, Restaurant etc.  
All this classification as a human we will understand.  

## How we will tell to the system about this entityâ€™s ?
Ans : through class we will define so that system will understand.
