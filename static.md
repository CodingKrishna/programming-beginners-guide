## What is static ?
Static is not interested to change.  
When a variable is declared with the keyword “static”, its called a “class variable”. All instances share the same copy of the variable.   
A class variable can be accessed directly with the class, without the need to create a instance.  

a static variable is a variable that has been allocated statically so that its lifetime is across the entire run of the program.  

This is in contrast to the more local variables are generally automatic, whose storage is allocated and deallocated on the call stack,  
and in contrast to objects whose storage is dynamically allocated in heap memory. 

Static memory allocation in general is the allocation of memory at compile time before the associated program is executed,   
unlike dynamic memory allocation or automatic memory allocation where memory is allocated as required at run time.
